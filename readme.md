# Myrmidon

A dead-simple, tiny task executor for Rofi.

## What

Myrmidon executes tasks for you, displaying something similar to modern text editor's command palette. You define the task names and commands, and let Myrmidon make a fuzzy search list to select and execute tasks.

## Why

I've been looking for something like this for a while since I started using i3. Sometimes not everything merits yet another keybinding to remember, nor a bunch of shell files laying around.

## Requirements

Myrmidon currently depends on:

- [Rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

## Installation / defining tasks

Copy the shell script in a directory included in your `PATH` (e.g: `~/bin`)

Define your tasks in a json file. The default location of the json file will be `$HOME/.myrmidon-tasks.json`, but you can pass an optional argument as a custom path for the configuration file (e.g: `./myrmidon.sh ~/my-custom-path/tasks.json`).

Each task is comprised of a `name`, `command` and whether or not it needs a confirmation screen (`confirm`).
`confirm` can either be just `true` if you only want to use the default, or you can customize it with an object.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Area screenshot",
    "command": "gnome-screenshot -a"
  },
  {
    "name": "Window screenshot",
    "command": "gnome-screenshot -w"
  },
  {
    "name": "Power off",
    "confirm": {
      "message": "Do you really want to shut down ?"
    },
    "command": "systemctl poweroff"
  },
  {
    "name": "Reboot",
    "confirm": true,
    "command": "systemctl reboot"
  },
  {
    "name": "Suspend",
    "confirm": {
      "invert": true,
      "yes": "Yep",
      "no": "Nope"
    },
    "command": "systemctl suspend"
  }
]
```

After configuring your tasks file, you would have to set up a keybinding, if needed, to make it work.

For example, in `i3`:

```
bindsym $mod+p exec --no-startup-id ~/bin/myrmidon.sh
```

## Multiple config files

As it is possible to provide an optional location of the config file, you can keep multiple keys for different task "categories", for example:

```
bindsym $mod+p exec --no-startup-id ~/bin/myrmidon.sh ~/common-tasks.json
bindsym $mod+Esc exec --no-startup-id ~/bin/myrmidon.sh ~/power-tasks.json
bindsym $mod+Print exec --no-startup-id ~/bin/myrmidon.sh ~/screenshot-tasks.json
```

This way, for example, $mod+Esc will now only show tasks related to power (Power off, restart, suspend, etc), as to not pollute the task pool.
